## What is a Token?

The [wikipedia page on Lexical Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) describes a token as "A lexical token or simply token is a pair consisting of a token name and an optional token value."


# Token objects

Lexer tokens are represented as `Token` objects, which may have any prototype inheritance but which implement the following interface:

```js
interface Token {
  type: string;
  loc: SourceLocation | undefined;
}
```

The `type` field is a string representing the token variant type. Each subtype of `Token` is documented below with the specific string of its `type` field. You can use this field to determine which interface a node implements.

The `loc` field represents the source location information of the node. If the node contains no information about the source location, the field is `undefined`; otherwise it is an object consisting of a start position (the position of the first character of the parsed source region) and an end position (the position of the first character after the parsed source region):

```js
interface SourceLocation {
  source: string | undefined;
  start: Position;
  end: Position;
}
```

Each `Position` object consists of a `line` number (1-indexed) and a `column` number (0-indexed):

```js
interface Position {
  line: number; // >= 1
  column: number; // >= 0
}
```

## Location information

```js
Location {
  start: Position { index: 0, column: 0, line: 1 },
  end: Position { index: 3, column: 3, line: 1 },
  range: [getter] // [start.index, end.index]
} 
```
